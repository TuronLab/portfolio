The <strong>EMPHASIS project</strong>, which stands for "Empowering Decision Making with Higher Productivity 
by Means of HyperAutomation," is an initiative dedicated to advancing the <strong>hyperautomation of back-office tasks</strong> 
through cutting-edge AI technologies, including <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> and speech processing. 
The project's primary goal is to support companies in their <strong>digital transformation</strong> by creating a versatile platform 
that can process <strong>unstructured data</strong>—such as documents and audio from calls—and convert it into 
structured, actionable information.
</p>

<p>
My team and I contributed to the development of the NLP components of the project, focusing on building key technological modules 
for <strong>Cognitive Document Automation (CDA)</strong>. These modules were designed to be adaptable across various use cases 
and languages, aligning with the project's <strong>low-code/no-code philosophy</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Our main areas of development included:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Text and Document Classification:</strong> We developed tools for extracting multi-format documents, fine-tuning 
    Large Language Models (LLMs), and automatically classifying texts and documents. This enabled the system to categorize 
    items such as invoices, delivery notes, and building permits, significantly streamlining their processing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Named Entity Recognition and Anonymization (NERC):</strong> We created a module to identify and classify specific 
    entities within a text—such as names, locations, and other sensitive information. A key feature of this module is 
    its <strong>anonymization capability</strong>, which replaces detected entities in a configurable way to ensure data privacy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Question Answering (QA):</strong> We developed a module that allows users to extract answers from large corpora 
    of text. It supports three search modes: <strong>semantic similarity</strong>, <strong>extractive QA</strong>, and 
    <strong>lexical search</strong>, making it a powerful tool for information retrieval in environments like FAQs.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These modules were implemented as <strong>REST APIs</strong> and integrated into the EMPHASIS platform, where they can be 
combined into configurable processing pipelines. Our work on these components delivered a <strong>flexible and powerful 
hyperautomation solution</strong>, capable of adapting to the unique needs of different clients and domains.
