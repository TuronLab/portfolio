  The <strong><a href="https://eithos.eu/" target="_blank">EITHOS project</a></strong> is part of <em>Horizon Europe's</em> mission to address the 
  rising threat of <strong>online identity theft</strong>. Running from 2022 to 2025, it is building 
  an integrated <strong>“Observatory System”</strong> that combines advanced <em>AI-driven detection 
  tools</em> with public awareness campaigns, aiming to both protect <strong>EU citizens</strong> and 
  support <strong>law enforcement agencies (LEAs)</strong> in their investigations. The consortium, coordinated 
  by the <strong>Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH)</strong>, brings together leading 
  research institutes, universities, technology providers, and <strong>law enforcement authorities</strong> from across 
  Europe.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>EITHOS</strong> addresses identity theft on several levels. Its technical work focuses 
  on detecting manipulated media such as <strong>deepfakes</strong>, monitoring fraudulent activity 
  across the <strong>surface web, deep web, and dark web</strong>, and applying <strong>Natural Language 
  Processing (NLP)</strong> to extract structured knowledge and build <em>multilingual knowledge graphs</em>. 
  Alongside these technologies, the project also examines the <em>legal and socio-psychological impact</em> 
  of identity theft, ensuring that its findings can guide <strong>EU policy</strong> and strengthen 
  <strong>victim support strategies</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Within this collaborative framework, our team contributed to the <strong>NLP workstream</strong>. We developed 
  methods to analyze <em>unstructured text data</em> from a wide range of online sources, including the 
  <strong>surface, deep, and dark web</strong>, providing insights into <strong>emerging fraud trends</strong> 
  and new <strong>attack vectors</strong>. By transforming raw textual data into <strong>actionable intelligence</strong>, 
  the team's efforts have enhanced the Observatory's capacity to both inform <em>public awareness initiatives</em> 
  and equip <strong>law enforcement agencies</strong> with advanced investigative tools.
