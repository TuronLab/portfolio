<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>
    Most of my professional work has been developed for private companies, 
    so the source code cannot be shared. However, several of these projects 
    have resulted in scientific publications, which provide an overview of my 
    contributions. My <a href="https://github.com/TuronLab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> 
    currently contains a couple of small personal project that I created when I was studying.
