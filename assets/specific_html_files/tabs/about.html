<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi! I'm <strong>Pablo Turón</strong>, an <strong>AI Engineer</strong> passionate about applying 
  technology to solve real-world problems. I studied Telecommunications and Technology Engineering 
  at the <strong>University of Zaragoza</strong>, where I discovered my love for using innovation 
  across diverse fields—even enhancing my own performance as a high-level athlete 
  <a href="#" class="about-link" data-id="story">(see the story here)</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My <strong>engineering thesis</strong> marked the beginning of my AI journey through an internship 
  at <a href="https://sallen.es/en/about-us/" target="_blank">Sallén Tech</a>. I developed a computer 
  vision system to recognise banknote patterns that achieved the company's accuracy goals in just 
  one-third of the usual computation time, even on low-resource hardware. This sparked my passion 
  for AI applications and led me to pursue an <strong>MSc in Artificial Intelligence</strong> at the 
  <strong>Polytechnic University of Madrid</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  During my master's, I entered the <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> field, working 
  with doctors at <strong>Hospital 12 de Octubre</strong> to build systems that automatically identified 
  and classified medical entities in clinical records—helping them extract valuable insights with ease.

<p>
  Since 2020, I have been part of the <a href="https://www.vicomtech.org/" target="_blank">Vicomtech</a> 
  NLP research team, contributing to both <strong>European and private projects</strong>. 
  My work spans <strong>Information Extraction, Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition (NERC), 
  Document Understanding, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>, leveraging both classical 
  techniques and <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>. Along the way, I have published research 
  in peer-reviewed journals and shared findings at international conferences 
  (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rFS7H6sAAAAJ&hl" target="_blank">check out my Google Scholar 
  profile</a> for details).
