<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

    Hi! I'm Pablo Turón, an AI engineer. I have always been passionate about technology and its 
    applications, which is why I decided to study Telecommunications and Technology Engineering 
    at the University of Zaragoza.
</p>
<p>
    During my university studies, I learned and applied lots of different technologies
    to really different areas, and I loved to apply new technologies to diverse areas, such as 
    the sport that I was training for, becoming a high-performance athlete thanks to the use of 
    these technologies <a href="#" class="about-link" data-id="story">(see the history here)</a>. 
</p>
<p>
    My engineering thesis allowed me to start my career in AI, giving me the opportunity be part of 
    an internship at <a href="https://sallen.es/en/about-us/" target="_blank">Sallén Tech</a>, where 
    I developed a computer vision system that could recognise banknote patterns. 
    This system achieved the company's target accuracy in one-third of the required computation time 
    on low-resource hardware. After this experience, I was passionated about the range of applications
    that the AI has, and I decided to specialize in this area by completing an MSc in Artificial 
    Intelligence in the Polytechnic University of Madrid. 
</p>
<p>
    This master gave me the opportunity to start my career in the Natural Language Processing 
    (NLP) field, by helping the doctors at the Hospital 12 de Octubre to identify and classify
    named entities in real clinical data, enabling them to analyse their records and extract 
    statistics about their patients automatically.
</p> 
<p>
    Nowadays, I work in the NLP team of the applied research center 
    <a href="https://www.vicomtech.org/" target="_blank">Vicomtech</a> since 2020. In this 
    experience, I have led and contributed to European projects and private projects. 
    These projects have involved a wide range of NLP tasks such as Information Extraction, Text 
    Classification, Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC), Document Understanding, 
    and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging both Large Language Models (LLMs) and 
    classical techniques. During this experience, I had the opportunity to contribute to science 
    by publishing our findings in different journals, and to participate in various conferences 
    (see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rFS7H6sAAAAJ&hl" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>).
