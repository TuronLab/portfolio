<h2>Sports material customization</h2>

<div class="about-content">
  <p>
    During my studies, I wanted to enhance my performance as a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biathlon" target="_blank">biathlete</a>, a sport
    that combines cross-country skiing with precision shooting. In this discipline, having a rifle
    fully adapted to your body is essential—every millimeter matters. This, combined with the
    emergence of the first DIY 3D printers, lead me and some friends to build our "low-cost" 3D
    printer built with hardware-store pieces to start building my initial personalized pieces for 
    my rifle.

    That 3D printer enabled me to produce my early prototypes and inspired me to sharpen my 3D
    design skills. Over time, I developed custom-made components for my rifle, which helped me
    become one of the top shooters on the Spanish biathlon team. Some of these designs involved
    using 3D scans of molds taken from my own body. Remarkably, three years after I created these
    parts, I started seeing similar designs appear at the Biathlon World Cup.
