<h2>Ski Pose Detection</h2>

<p>
    During my participation in the <a href="https://www.biathlonworld.com/inside-ibu/development/ibu-ioc-camps" target="_blank">IBU-IOC Virtual Camps 2020</a>,  
    organized by the <a href="https://www.biathlonworld.com/" target="_blank">International Biathlon Union (IBU)</a>,  
    I attended a technique analysis session led by Stefan Lindinger. In this session, I  
    noticed that each study relied on expensive sensors—not accessible to every team.  
    Therefore, I decided to spend the remaining afternoons exploring the application of different  
    AI-based strategies for pose detection and sharing my findings with coaches from various  
    national teams, receiving positive feedback from them.

    Since it was a summer camp, I recorded myself training on rollerskis—the summer adaptation of skiing—for the demo.
