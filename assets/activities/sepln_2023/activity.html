  I had the opportunity to present our work entitled <i><a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3496/mentalriskes-paper6.pdf" target="_blank">"Text Classification For Early Detection of Eating Disorders and Depression in Spanish"</a></i> at the <a href="http://sepln2023.sepln.org/">SEPLN 2023 conference</a>, an event focused on NLP research. Our study, which addresses the early detection of different mental health risks, received very positive feedback and generated insightful questions from both the committee and the participants.

  During the conference, I also had the chance to attend a wide variety of talks and engage with other NLP researchers, which fostered valuable discussions and new connections.
