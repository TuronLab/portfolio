  As part of the educational program of the <a href="https://eithos.eu/">EITHOS project</a>, I delivered a workshop at my former high school, <i>IES Pedro La√≠n Entralgo</i>. The session was designed for students aged 14-15 and focused on raising awareness about the risks of the internet and the techniques used by hackers to commit identity theft. I introduced both classical methods and more advanced approaches powered by artificial intelligence. To make the workshop engaging and practical, I illustrated each risk with real-world examples and conducted a live demonstration of <i>"face swapping",</i> which the students actively tested during the session.
