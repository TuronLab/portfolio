  At the <a href="https://sepln2022.grupolys.org/">2022 SEPLN conference</a>, I presented a study on detecting harmful social media content titled <i><a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3202/davincis-paper4.pdf" target="_blank">"Vicomtech at DA-VINCIS: Detection of Aggressive and Violent Incidents from Social Media in Spanish"</a></i>. The project aimed to issue early alerts to authorities whenever such content was identified. It was well received and sparked conversations about the technical challenges and ethical considerations of using NLP for online safety.

  During the event, I attended a variety of sessions that deepened my understanding of current NLP issues and helped me connect with researchers exploring related areas.
