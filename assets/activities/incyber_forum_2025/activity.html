  I represented the <a href="https://eithos.eu/">EITHOS project</a> at the <a href="https://europe.forum-incyber.com/en/home-en/">INCYBER Forum</a>, one of the world's leading cybersecurity events. Together with my teammates, I presented and promoted the project at the EU Pavilion, engaging with professionals and organizations interested in our work.

  In addition to showcasing our project, I explored other exhibitors' stands, connecting with companies to learn about their solutions and approaches. This experience broadened my perspective on how AI is applied across different industries and inspired new ideas for potential collaborations with the applied research center where I currently work.
