  In the winter of 2024, I presented our research titled <i><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-97-3289-0_45" target="_blank">"Emails Classification: Comparing Statistics, Machine-Learning, Deep-Learning, and ChatGPT Prompting Techniques"</a></i> at the ICICT Conference in London. Our work focused on email classification, comparing the performance of various AI models—from traditional techniques to modern approaches—on real-world datasets.

  Since the conference was not limited to a specific domain, I had the opportunity to explore a wide variety of AI applications across different fields. Attending these talks allowed me to broaden my perspective and engage in insightful discussions with researchers, authors, and industry professionals.
